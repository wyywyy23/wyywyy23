> "Embrace light. Admire it. Love it. But above all, know light." â€” George Eastman

I am a Postdoctoral Research Scientist in the [Lightwave Research Laboratory](https://lightwave.ee.columbia.edu) at the Columbia University in the City of New York, supervised by [Prof. Keren Bergman](https://lightwave.ee.columbia.edu/bergman). I design **large-scale integrated photonic systems** to transform future computing paradigms. Addressing communication bottlenecks in AI/machine learning applications through embedded photonic I/O and heterogeneous integration, I aim to redefine chip-to-chip connectivity with unparalleled density and novel functionalities beyond data communication.
